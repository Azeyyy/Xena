  "body": "### Xena.\r\nXena is a CS:GO (Counter Strike GO) cheat made from scratch and written in Java. Xena has been designed from the ground up with garbage-free, high performance, low resource usage programming practices in mind. Xena works thanks to the power on JNA (https://github.com/java-native-access/jna) to provide very easy direct mapping to native classes.\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n- [JMM](https://github.com/Jonatino/Java-Memory-Manipulation) for our high-level cross-platform interfacing with processes\r\n- [Java Native Access (JNA)](https://github.com/java-native-access/jna) as the backbone for interfacing with native libraries\r\n- [Offset-Scanner](https://github.com/Jonatino/Abendigo-Offset-Scanner) for automatically updating offsets/netvars realtime\r\n\r\n### So... what's to come?\r\nXena is more of a side project I seem to fall back into every couple of months. While I 'do' have plans for it, I can not provide any ETA. So without further ado, here are some features you can look forward to (possibly contribute yourself <3)\r\n- Gradle \r\n- Cross-Platform (Note: the cheat it's self is cross paltform, but I need the atterns for offsets for the Offset Scanner)\r\n- Some type of configuration tool to change esp color/aim settings etc.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@Jonatino - Started this project with @Jire, made my own cross-platform memory editing library, also made the offset/netvar scanner that Xena uses\r\n\r\n@Jire - We both have worked on and maintained another CS:GO cheat by the name of 'Abendigo'\r\n",
